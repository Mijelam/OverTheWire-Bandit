## Level 7

### Instructions:

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**

### Thought process:

This is quite easy, we just have to use **grep** to filter by the given word, in this case **" millionth "**  there is no need to use **cat**  to read the file first.
